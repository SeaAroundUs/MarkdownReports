  plotname = substitute(variable), main = substitute(variable), w = 7,
  h = 7, incrBottMarginBy = 0, mdlink = F, tilted_text = F, hline = F,

}
\arguments{
\item{variable}{The variable to plot.}

\item{...}{Pass any other parameter of the corresponding plotting function (most of them should work).}

\item{col}{Color of the plot.}

\item{sub}{Subtitle for the plot.}

\item{plotname}{The name of the file saved.}

\item{main}{The title of the plot.}

\item{w}{Width of the saved pdf image, in inches.}

\item{h}{Height of the saved pdf image, in inches.}

\item{incrBottMarginBy}{Increase the blank space at the bottom of the plot. Use if labels do not fit on the plot.}

\item{mdlink}{Insert a .pdf and a .png image link in the markdown report, set by "Log_PnF".}

\item{tilted_text}{Use 45 degree x-labels if TRUE. Useful for long, but not too many labels.}

\item{hline}{Draw a horizontal line at the value you pass on to it. Useful to display a threshold. Design the line by "lty", "lwd" & "lcol" parameters.}

\item{vline}{Draw a vertical line at the value you pass on to it. Useful to display a threshold. Design the line by "lty", "lwd" & "lcol" parameters.}

\item{filtercol}{Color bars below / above the threshold with red / green. Define the direction by -1 or 1. Takes effect if "hline" is defined.}

\item{lty}{Linetype, defined by numbers 1-6.}

\item{lwd}{Line width. Set to 2 by default.}

\item{lcol}{Color of the line.}

\item{errorbar}{Draw error bars if TRUE. Pass on the value in parameters "upper" and "lower". Refine the look by "w" and "arrow_lwd".}

\item{upper}{Size of the upper error bar.}

\item{lower}{Size of the lower error bar. By default, it equals the upper error bar.}

\item{arrow_lwd}{Line width for the error bar arrow.}

\item{w}{Width of the saved pdf image, in inches.idth}
}
\description{
Create and save bar plots as .pdf, in "OutDir". If mdlink =T, it inserts a .pdf and a .png link in the markdown report, set by "Log_PnF". The .png version is not created, only the link is put in place, not to overwrite previous versions.
