{"name":"MarkDownLogs","tagline":"An R function library to generate (scientific) reports easily","body":"## What is MarkDownLogs\r\n\r\nMarkDownLogs is a set of **R** functions that allows you to generate summaries what you discovered with your source code. It helps you to:\r\n\r\n1. Write down your findings in an easy, clear and nicely formatted way.\r\n- Support your findings with quick & pretty figures saved along your report\r\n- Link and show these in your markdown or html document\r\n- Share your findings\r\n\r\n \r\n## Why did I make it, why you might like it?\r\n\r\nI do exploratory data analysis as daily routine, and I have constant interaction with all sorts of people: supervisors, collaborators, colleagues, etc. I often ...\r\n\r\n1. ...have to write emails summarizing the results (text accompanied by figures) of the last few days.\r\n2. ...find back results a couple of month back, with all tiny details (parameters used, etc)\r\n3. ...assemble each step I did that day into a logical story line, that others can follow right as they see it, e.g.: *I observed X; I controlled for Y; Hypothesized explanation A; Falsified it; Came up with explanation B; Tested & proven it...*\r\n\t\r\nFor all of the above, my solution is MarkDownLogs. I think its better than other solutions I found, like  that combine source code with results. Most of people I interact with are not interested in the source code, but are very keen on seeing all kind of validations.\r\n\r\n#### It is better than existing report generators\r\n\r\n- Pure Markdown output, Simple and Elegant layout.\r\n- Integration with figures (linked to an external file & displayed: makes manual tailoring easy)\r\n- Easy generation of accurate figures (axis labels, etc) that are saved as a vector graphic (pdf): scalable for presentations, posters, etc\r\n- Named as source file + date: relate to the script, but avoid overwriting.\r\n- Does not spam your report with code, but its linked to it via its name, so you can look it up of if needed. (iPython notebook, KnittR)\r\n- Usable on GitHub Wiki's (although GitHub at the moment cannot)\r\n- Native export of tables from R to Markdown\r\n- Its all achieved in ~ 200 lines of well commented code.\r\n\r\n## Discover\r\n\r\n-  See it working: Check out a dummy [R script](https://github.com/vertesy/MarkDownLogs/blob/master/Usage_Example_Script.R) \r\n and the [MarkDown report](https://github.com/vertesy/MarkDownLogs/blob/master/Usage_Example_Script/Usage_Example_Script.R.log.md) \r\n it generates inside this [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/vertesy/MarkDownLogs).\r\n \r\n- Check the function documentation in the [wiki](https://github.com/vertesy/MarkDownLogs/wiki)\r\n- Visit the [project's webpage](https://vertesy.github.io/MarkDownLogs/)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[*edit this page*](https://github.com/vertesy/MarkDownLogs/generated_pages/new)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
